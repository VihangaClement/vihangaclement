## Hi thereðŸ‘‹ I'm Vihanga

#### I'm a 2010-born boy who likes to develop websites and systems. Since 2017, I have been a developer with experience in Python, web development, and systems programming. I enjoy crafting elegant solutions that balance simplicity and functionality.

##### I'm so fricking sick and tired of the code
